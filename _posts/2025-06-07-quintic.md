As mentioned in my blog post on the [Gromov–Witten invariants of complex projective space]({% post_url 2025-05-01-gromov-witten-calculations %}), I am currently writing a thesis on Gromov–Witten invariants. I'll leave an explanation of what they are to that post; in this post, I want to focus on my numerical calculation of the Gromov–Witten invariants of the quintic and a slight nod to the physical application of Gromov–Witten invariants.

### Gromov–Witten invariants in physics

Of course, for the entire story of the relevance of Gromov–Witten in physics, one would have to read my thesis (or any other source). Long story short, the correlators in an A-twisted topological string theory on a manifold \\(X\\) look like
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    \langle\mathcal{O}\_1\cdots\mathcal{O}\_n\rangle = \sum_{g\geq 0}\sum_{\beta\in H_2(X;\mathbb{Z})}g_s^{2g-2}e^{-\langle\omega,\beta\rangle}GW_{g,n,\beta}^X(\alpha_1\otimes\cdots\otimes\alpha_n),
\end{equation}
</div>
where the \\(\mathcal{O}\_i\\) are operator insertions that correspond to some cohomology classes \\(\alpha\_i\\), \\(\omega\\) is the complexified Kähler form and \\(g_s\\) is the string coupling constant. There also exists another twist, the B-twist, whose (genus zero) correlators are straightforwardly calculated as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    \langle\mathcal{O}\_1\cdots\mathcal{O}\_n\rangle\_{g=0} = g\_s^{-2}\int\_X \Omega\smile\Omega(\alpha\_1\smile\cdots\smile\alpha\_n),
\end{equation}
</div>
where the \\(\mathcal{O}\_i\\) now correspond to \\(\Lambda^\bullet TX\\)-valed antiholomorhic forms \\(\alpha\_i\\), and \\(\Omega\\) is a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic top-form on \\(X\\) (which is therefore required to be Calabi–Yau).

Conjecturally, there is a relationship between an A-twisted theory on one Calabi–Yau threefold and a B-twisted theory on another called mirror symmetry. This relationship allows one to compute Gromov–Witten invariants using B-twisted correlators on the mirror manifold. The most (mathematically) useful way of stating mirror symmetry is an active area of research, and it remains unknown what a minimal requirement on a Calabi–Yau threefold is to assure it admits mirror symmetry. The most prominent "mirror theorems", i.e., theorem that states whether a manifold admits mirror symmetry, are developed by Givental, for example [(Givental, 1997)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.alg-geom/9701016), which was on toric complete intersections. The origin of mirror symmetry, however, lies in [(Greene–Plesser, 1990)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(90)90622-K), and the first Gromov–Witten invariant computations were done in [(Candelas et al., 1991)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(91)90292-6). The latter considers the quintic threefold (a degree five projective variety in \\(\mathbb{CP}^4\\)), and conjectures its mirror manifold, from which the Gromov–Witten invariants are computed. This method was proven by Givental in [(Givental, 1996)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.alg-geom/9603021).

### The quintic

The goal of this blog post is not at all to explore this method in detail (read my thesis for that!), but rather to sketch how I computed the Gromov–Witten invariants numerically. We will start from the following expression,
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    q(b) = b\exp\left(5\frac{\sum\_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(5n)!}{(n!)^5}\left(\sum\_{j=n+1}^{5n}\frac{1}{j}\right)b^n}{1 + \sum\_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(5n)!}{(n!)^5}b^n}\right),
\end{equation}
</div>
which is the mirror map. In our Python script below, this is `q_func`. It describes a map from the complex moduli space of the quintic mirror (the B-twisted structure) to the Kähler moduli space of the quintic (the A-twisted structure). We now want to invert this to a \\(b(q)\\), denoted `b_func` in our script. We'll be doing a numerical calculation, so we should first express \\(q(b)\\) as a power series, and then use a smart theorem that allows us to invert a power series into another power series.

First, turning \\(q(b)\\) into a power series is quite straightforward — one simply uses the Taylor series of the exponential and \\(\frac{1}{1+x}\\), which are known to most undergrads.

The aforementioned smart theorem is the Lagrange inversion theorem. For \\(q(b) = \sum\_{n\geq 1}q\_nb^n\\) as above, we can use \\(q(0)=0\\) to find its inverse \\(b(q) = \sum_{n\geq 1}b\_nq^n\\) with
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    b\_n = \lim\_{b\to 0}\frac{\mathrm{d}^{n-1}}{\mathrm{d}b^{n-1}}\left(\frac{b}{f(b)}\right)^n.
\end{equation}
</div>
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_inversion_theorem#Statement) lists the following variant, citing C.A. Charalambides's *Enumerative Combinatorics* (to which I sadly don't have access),
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    b\_n = \frac{1}{q\_1^n}\sum\_{k=1}^{n-1}(-1)^k\frac{(n+k-1)!}{(n-1)!}B\_{n-1,k}(\hat{q}\_1,\dots,\hat{q}\_{n-k}),
\end{equation}
</div>
for \\(B_{n-1,k}\\) a [Bell polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_polynomials) and
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    \hat{q}\_k = \frac{q\_{k+1}}{(k+1)q\_1}.
\end{equation}
</div>
The Bell polynomial can simply be imported from `sympy`, significantly simplifying the process. This gives us a power series for \\(b(q)\\) that is precise up to some degree of our choosing.

Next up, we should calculate the correlators. In the B-twist, we can derive that the three-point function is given by
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    \langle\mathcal{O}\_\theta\mathcal{O}\_\theta\mathcal{O}\_\theta\rangle = \frac{5/(2\pi i)^3}{(1-5^5b)\left(1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(5n)!}{(n!)^5}b^n\right)^2}.
\end{equation}
</div>
We then derive that the A-twist three-point function is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    \langle\mathcal{O}\_H\mathcal{O}\_H\mathcal{O}\_H\rangle = \frac{5}{(1-5^5b(q))\left(1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(5n)!}{(n!)^5}b(q)^n\right)^2}\left(\frac{q}{b(q)}\frac{\mathrm{d}b(q)}{\mathrm{d}q}\right)^3.
\end{equation}
</div>
For this, we use more numerical evaluation of products, fractions and derivatives to construct a power series of \\(\langle\mathcal{O}\_H\mathcal{O}\_H\mathcal{O}\_H\rangle\\), which is very doable. We then find the following:
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
    \langle\mathcal{O}\_H\mathcal{O}\_H\mathcal{O}\_H\rangle = 5 + 2{,}875q + 4{,}876{,}875q^2 + 8{,}564{,}575{,}000q^3+\dots.
\end{equation}
</div>

The final step is to take the power series above and compute the Gromov–Witten invariants \\(N_0(d)\\) and instanton numbers \\(n_0(d)\\). We find the following results up to degree five:

| \\(\boldsymbol{d}\\)      | \\(\boldsymbol{1}\\)   | \\(\boldsymbol{2}\\)   | \\(\boldsymbol{3}\\)   | \\(\boldsymbol{4}\\)   | \\(\boldsymbol{5}\\)   |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| \\(\boldsymbol{N_0(d)}\\) | \\(2{,}875\\)                | \\(\frac{4{,}876{,}875}{8}\\)                | \\(\frac{8{,}564{,}575{,}000}{27}\\)               | \\(\frac{15{,}517{,}926{,}796{,}875}{64}\\)              | \\(229{,}305{,}888{,}887{,}648\\)            |
| \\(\boldsymbol{n_0(d)}\\) | \\(2{,}875\\)                | \\(609{,}250\\)                | \\(317{,}206{,}375\\)               | \\(242{,}467{,}530{,}000\\)              | \\(229{,}305{,}888{,}887{,}625\\)            |

It takes our program very little time to derive these. In fact, up to degree \\(15\\), the program proves very fast. Beyond this, however, the speed decreases quickly.

### Implementation

Below, you can find my implementation. A good first step to improvement is to increase calculation speed is to sequentially calculate each degree, outputting intermediate results and allowing those values to be used for future calculations. In the current form, the entire calculation has to be redone for every degree if you want to find another degree. However, for the purpose of my thesis, finding the numbers up to degree five is plenty.
