### Welcome!

This is the lander of my personal webpage. Here, you can find information about my research, publications and my LaTeX projects. Moreover, I (try to) keep up with a blog, where I share discussions about niche topics.

### About me

I am a theoretical physics and mathematical sciences student as Utrecht University, specialising in geometry. I will be starting a PhD project in mathematics in September of 2025 (more information on that will follow as soon as I start the project).
